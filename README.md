The main learning objectives of this tutorial project were to:
1. Get familiar with node js
2. learn how to create a website using javascript
3. develop express apps

Challenges:
1. This was only at the beginning, but it was how to run the command prompt. Since I'm used to GUIs for navigation, this was a minor hurdle that was quickly overcome after looking into prompt commands.
2. Understanding lists and functions. They seem to be different from other coding languages, but maybe it was just the layout throwing me off. Simple exposure to the code is all it takes to overcome this challenge of not understanding (and writing the code)

How this helps for future projects:
I'm not sure this will be of much use except for function references. I likely would structure the file system differently, and I probably wouldn't use the same form templates or file type. What did help out for future projects is understanding what happens behind the webpage, and also understanding how much of the internet works.
